# How do I learn to code?
The short answer is you never learn all of it.
OTOH, you've probably already done a tiny bit of programming on your thermostat.
But, if you want to learn more, I'd recommend the following steps to get as deep as you like.
And remember:
> It's not as much about knowing the exact specifications of language as how to articulate and solve problems.

# Learn a Language (Python)
Python is a very good first language because it's designed to force good, readable code.
It is also a modern, general purpose language used for literally anything.
There are other specialty languages better suited for certain purposes, but that comes later.
- First, for inspiration, read the [Zen of Python][0].
- Then, do Google's short [tutorial][1].
  - Or at very least, do their [python setup][2].
- If you like book learning, read the one recommended by the inventor of Python:
  - ["Introduction to Computer Science Using Python: A Computational Problem-Solving Focus"][3]
  - In case it's your birthday, I may have already bought you a hard copy. :wink:
- Along the way, you'll also start learning the command line.
  - This is particularly useful if you're on Mac or Linux (can't speak for Windows).

# Solve Small Puzzles "for Others"
It's important to work on some small problems to learn what a langauge can do (without drowning in new info).
It's even better if you can do this in a context of a community where you can get feedback and see alternative solutions.
- Don't mind the strange title and try [exercism.io][4] for general programming puzzles.
- In case you like particularly mathy programming puzzles, my personal favorite is [Project Euler][5].

# Tackle an Open-ended Problem for Yourself
Find something you want to:
- automate (time tracker?)
- share (website?)
- play (game?)
- emulate (someone else's project?)

You will almost certainly not know enough when you begin.
You may even need or want to find and use an appropriate framework / library to extend Python.
Regardless, you will start on a long journey of reading documentation and [Stack Overflow][7]. :)

## Isolate your Project Environments
If Python alone is not enough and you need to install dependencies, make sure to [setup environments][8].
Don't be shy to ask someone to do this for you the first time (like Code for Nasvhille, below).

## Learn Source Control (Git)
For any project bigger than a language puzzle, you'll want to track changes as you develop.
If you invest in learning source control, you'll want to use it for everything (how did I survive before?).
In fact, if you pay close attention, some of the puzzle sites above track your changes in source control. :)
- "Git" is a distributed source control tool invented so thousands of developers could collaborate to make Linux. :fireworks:
- [Github][6] is a website for sharing code using git
  - They have a [puzzle series][9] (see a pattern, yet?) to teach git.
- Atlassian also has good conceptual resources, but skip to these sections:
  - [Begninner](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
  - [Getting Started](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository)
  - [Collaborating](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing) (wait until you're collaborating)
- There are lots of GUI's for git, but I'd recommend learning on the command line eventually (you'll go further).

This is all a lot easier with people to answer questions.
So, perhaps this is when you start going to meetups (or ask me). :)

# Solve a Big Problem for Someone Else
Part of practical programming is figuring out what keeps the customer satisfied.
You can learn on the job or join an open source project / community and chip in.
- [Code For Nashville][10] builds apps to help the local community (free, open source, civic hacking!)

# Learn a Second Language
Pick a practical specialized language to learn about a different problem domain
- Frontend development (what a non-technical user sees): Javascript
- Database development (where everything is stored permanently): SQL

Or pick an "academic" general purpose language to learn different styles of programming.
- Functional Programming: Clojure
- Strongly Typed Programming: Haskell

# Generalize Your Programming Concepts
Maybe you've found you're really passionate about programming.
Then, you should start thinking about problems abstracted from a programming language.
You should have already been stretched a bit, but now might be a good time to hit it straight on.
- Blogs are a great way to get exposed to concepts and terminology to learn in depth later.
- When you want to go deep, my favorite book is the "Wizard Book": [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][11]
